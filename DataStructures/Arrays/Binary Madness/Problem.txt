Binary Madness
Given a non-negative integer, find the count of substrings with an odd number of 0s in its binary representation and the count of substrings with an odd number of 1s in its binary representation.

Input Format
First line of input t denotes the number of test cases. Next t lines follow each containing a non-negative integer n.

Output Format
For each test case print the count of substrings with an odd number of 0s in its binary representation and the count of substrings with an odd number of 1s in its binary representation.

Constraints
1 <= t <= 100 
0 <= n <= 10200

Explanation
For the number 17, the binary representation is 10001. Of all the 15 substrings, the following 9 substrings have odd number of 0s.

10
1000
10001
0
000
0001
0
0
01
And the following 8 substrings have odd number of 1s.

1
10
100
1000
0001
001
01
1
Hence answer is 9 8.
